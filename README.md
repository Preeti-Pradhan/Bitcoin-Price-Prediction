## BITCOIN PRICE PREDICTION
Data Science Project where I will collect the data, explore it , clean it and finally come up with a predictive model with the right features to predict the prices of bitcoins in the future.

Introduction to Numpy, Pandas , Request Module

After you download the dataset, complete the following steps :
Step-1: Import pandas and read the CSV file using the panda's module.
Step-2 : After reading the CSV file, try the head() function out.
Step-3: Now, using pandas, find out what the 1024th value in the 'btc_market_price

# Microtask - 3
Microtask-3 ventures with performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to decide which features correlate with our desired output variable. In this case, 'btc_market_price' is the desired output variable. You can start by using jointplots to analyze the data.

# Microtask - 4
Since many fields are filled with NaN/empty values, you're supposed to fill it with some value like mean, median and mode of the column. 

# Microtask - 5
In Microtask-5, you will be working on making predictions. The dataset must be split into 2 parts, namely your 'train set' and 'test set'. After you train your model, test it on the test set, and finally compute "MEAN SQUARED ERROR"
